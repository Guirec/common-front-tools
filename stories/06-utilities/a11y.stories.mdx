# Accessibility

Utility classes are useful for accessibility matters, if enabled.

## Visually hide content

```html
u-visually-hidden
```

This class will hide the content visually, but screen readers (and also search engines) will get the content. Note that you will not able to use breakpoints class extensions with this particular utility.
