# Spacers

Spacing in a page is a very critical point. Being consistent is a very great key to a good looking interface, so set the rules with a range of spacing options lead to the greatest level of consistancy.

I love using multiples of 8 as a reference to space elements. But 8px can be a little too much as minimum, so I start with 4px for the smallest spacer:

| Name | value |
| :--: | :---: |
| xxs  |  4px  |
|  xs  |  8px  |
|  sm  | 16px  |
|  md  | 24px  |
|  lg  | 32px  |
|  xl  | 40px  |
| 2xl  | 48px  |
| 3xl  | 80px  |
