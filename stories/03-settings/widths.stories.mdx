# Widths

Set a maximum with for the container allow to set the limit of your website layout. This limit should not be set too hight, very large screens are not the norm. I generally use a maximum width of **1440px**, which is already a lot.

## Fractions

I also define several common widths which correspond to a fraction of the parent:

| Fraction | Percentage |
| :------: | :--------: |
|   1/4    |    25%     |
|   1/3    |  33.3333%  |
|   1/2    |    50%     |
|   2/3    |  66.6667%  |
|   3/4    |    75%     |
