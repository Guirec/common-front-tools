# Breakpoints

Different screen sizes require different adaptations, but keep the number of breakpoints as low as possible is a good way to reduce complexity.

| Screen size |         Value          |
| :---------: | :--------------------: |
|    Small    |        < 768px         |
|   Medium    | >= 768px and <= 1024px |
|    Large    |        > 1024px        |
